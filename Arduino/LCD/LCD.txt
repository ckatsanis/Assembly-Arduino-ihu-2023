  LiquidCrystal Library - Hello World

   Demonstrates the use of a 16x2 LCD display.
  The LiquidCrystal library works with all LCD
  displays that are compatible with the  Hitachi
  HD44780 driver. There are many of them out
  there, and you  can usually tell them by the
  16-pin interface.

  This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD
  and shows the time.

  The circuit:
  * LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
  * LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
  * LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
  * LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
  * LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
  * LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
  * LCD R/W pin to ground
  * LCD VSS pin to ground
  * LCD VCC pin to 5V
  * 10K resistor:
  * ends to +5V and ground
  * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
